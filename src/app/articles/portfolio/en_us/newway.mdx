# The demand

[Newway Intermedia√ß√µes](https://newwayintermediacoes.com.br/)\* is a platform to buy and sell vehicles that target dealers \(companies\), where final users can publish their cars and companies can see those publishings.
Instead of usual car reselling sites, like CarGurus, focused on the user, Newway is focused on the reverse path: provide an infrastructure to fill the stock of the companies.
Soon will be implemented the feature of trade at companies, where dealers can buy and sell by themselves.
The idea came from a freelancing of a client that saw the poor supply for dealers and attacked that pain, provide for dealers, not the final user.

\* Newway was thought to work only on Brazil, so, if sold, this system must be adapted for the target country.

# Stack choices

Me and my brother have developed the solution based on previous technologies that we know and are designed for performance and scalability

- Backend: Django + Django REST Framework
- Frontend: Next.js
- Database: MySQL, with Django's ORM integration

Next.js was chosen thinking on a future port of the application for mobile, using Expo, that shares designs with Next.js, making the port easier.

Also, cryptography was implemented to protect sensitive data (but how is a secret ü§£).

# Application's architecture

This the general application distribution:
- Backend (Django):
    - auth: gerenciamento de autentica√ß√£o e tokens
    - cars: controle de ve√≠culos, demandas e negocia√ß√µes
- Frontend (Next.js):
    - Pages distributed by user type: client (final user), dealer (company) and admin
- JWT auth with three types of token:
    - Access Token: access of protected routes
    - Refresh Token: renews the expired access token
    - Action Token: temporary token for unique actions (ex: redefine password)

# Current functionalities

## Auth

- Login with Google or e-mail/password
- Password recovery with action token

## Vehicle Trade

- Direct trade: final users post their vehicles for selling
- On demand trade: the dealer registers value and year ranges for the desired vehicles
- The system matches automaticly posts and demands

## Admins e mediation

Admins play an important role:
- Create and remove post or demands
- Mediate trades between dealers and final users
- Earn comission with the trades
- Admin dashboard: trades infos

# Next features

- Dealer-dealer trade: allow dealers to trade cars with themselves
- Advanced search: filtering by company, name, year, value and other features.
- Admin dashboard: statistics and cash flow control (Probable)

# Final thoughts

Newway Intermedia√ß√µes is a solution to fill in a gap on automarker, focused on the dealer.

With a robust set, modern technologies and majorly thought on longevity, the system is currently working and will keep evolving, with expansion for mobile as soon as possible.
